# LangChain Framework Overview

LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications that leverage large language models (LLMs). It provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to build sophisticated AI applications.

## Core Components

### Chains
Chains are sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities. They allow you to combine multiple operations into a single, cohesive workflow. For example, you might chain together a prompt template, an LLM call, and output parsing.

### Agents
Agents are autonomous entities that can use tools to accomplish tasks. They make decisions about which actions to take based on user input and the results of previous actions. Agents are particularly useful for complex tasks that require multiple steps or external data sources.

### Memory
Memory components help maintain context across conversations. They can store and retrieve information from previous interactions, enabling more coherent and contextually aware responses.

### Tools
Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with external systems or perform specific operations. Examples include web search, database queries, calculators, and API calls.

## Use Cases

LangChain is ideal for:
- Building chatbots and virtual assistants
- Document question-answering systems
- Data analysis and reporting tools
- Content generation applications
- Research and knowledge management systems

## Integration

LangChain supports integration with various LLM providers including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, and open-source models through Hugging Face.
