# Azure OpenAI Service Guide

Azure OpenAI Service provides access to OpenAI's advanced language models through Microsoft Azure's cloud infrastructure, offering enterprise-grade capabilities and compliance.

## Available Models

### GPT-4 Series
- GPT-4: Most capable model for complex tasks
- GPT-4 Turbo: Optimized for speed and cost
- GPT-4 Vision: Multimodal model with image understanding

### GPT-3.5 Series
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: Fast and cost-effective for most tasks
- GPT-3.5 Turbo 16k: Extended context window version

### Embedding Models
- text-embedding-ada-002: General-purpose embeddings
- text-embedding-3-small: Smaller, faster embeddings
- text-embedding-3-large: Higher quality embeddings

## Key Features

### Enterprise Security
- Virtual network support for private connectivity
- Customer-managed keys for encryption
- Azure Active Directory integration
- Compliance with major standards (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001)

### Content Filtering
- Built-in content moderation
- Customizable filtering policies
- Protection against harmful content
- Compliance with responsible AI principles

### Regional Availability
- Multiple Azure regions worldwide
- Data residency options
- Low-latency access globally

### Monitoring and Management
- Azure Monitor integration
- Detailed usage analytics
- Cost management tools
- Rate limiting and quotas

## Deployment Types

### Standard Deployment
- Shared infrastructure
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Automatic scaling
- Suitable for most applications

### Provisioned Throughput
- Reserved capacity
- Predictable performance
- Dedicated resources
- Ideal for high-volume applications

## Getting Started

1. Create an Azure OpenAI resource in Azure Portal
2. Request access to desired models
3. Deploy a model to your resource
4. Get API keys and endpoints
5. Start making API calls

## Pricing

Pricing is based on:
- Token usage (input and output tokens)
- Model type (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
- Deployment type (standard vs provisioned)
- Region

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate models for each task (don't over-engineer)
- Implement caching to reduce costs
- Monitor token usage regularly
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Use system messages effectively
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider batch processing for bulk operations
